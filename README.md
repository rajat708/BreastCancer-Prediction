# BreastCancer-Prediction
The objective of this system is to develop a sophisticated new diagnostic system which implements K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm using various normalization techniques.  This project submission focuses on the development of an automated system that yields accurate and reproducible results for predicting whether a cancer tumor is benign or malignant. Different distance metrices considered for the same include Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, Chebyshev distance and Cosine distance. Different normalization techniques include Min-Max, Z-Score and Decimal Scaling. These various techniques and metrices have been undertaken in order to check the efficiency of the proposed algorithm at different values of ‘K’. The accuracy of each normalization technique is tested for every distance metric and the maximum accurate prediction is considered for the final output.
